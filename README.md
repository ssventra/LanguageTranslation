This repository is based on the research conducted for the translation of English text to Konkani text. This domain has remained untouched for a long time and Konkani is one of the 22 official languages in India. Hence, there is a necessity for a translation machine for this language. The text dataset consists of a pair of 70000 English and Konkani sentences, which are trained on a Sequence-to-Sequence model (Encoder-Decoder) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to obtain an output with 63.62% accuracy. Also, the research is done on the fine-tuning of hyper- parameters, optimizers, and regularisation techniques.
